# [VAWEs (Viscoacoustic Anisotropic Wave Equations)](https://github.com/xqihao)
The Mathematica codes for the point-source radiation from the scalar viscoacoustic orthorhombic wave equation.

The wave equation plays a central role in seismic modeling, processing, imaging and inversion. Incorporating attenuation anisotropy into the acoustic anisotropic wave equations provides a choice for acoustic forward and inverse modeling in attenuating anisotropic media. However, the existing viscoacoustic anisotropic wave equations are obtained for a specified viscoacoustic model. We have developed a relatively general representation of the scalar and vector viscoacoustic wave equations for orthorhombic anisotropy. We also obtain the viscoacoustic wave equations for transverse isotropy as a special case. The viscoacoustic orthorhombic wave equations are flexible for multiple viscoacoustic models. We take into account the classic visocoacoustic models such as the Kelvin-Voigt, Maxwell, standard-linear-solid and Kjartansson models, and we derive the corresponding viscoacoustic wave equations in differential form. To analyze the wave propagation in viscoacoustic models, we derive the asymptotic acoustic point-source radiation. Numerical examples indicate a comparison of the acoustic waveforms excited by a point source in the viscoacoustic orthorhombic models and the corresponding nonattenuating model, and the effect of the attenuation anisotropy on the acoustic waveforms.

## Output Figures
The output figures are exactly the same as those in the journal paper. All these figures are the vector plots save in the PDF format.


## Suggestions
We strongly suggest you first reading the journal paper and then running the codes to reporduce the figures. This may help you understand the whole theory about viscoacoustic anisotropy in the paper.
